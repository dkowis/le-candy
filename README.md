#Little Elephant Candy Kata

The Kata.feature file has everything you need to know about the Kata.


## Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.1.2
* bundler
* rake


## Setup instructions using RVM
`curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.1.2` For more details see https://rvm.io/rvm/install

You'll need to `gem install bundler` after getting ruby 2.1.2 installed. Easiest way to do this:

* clone this repo
* cd into the repo's dir (if RVM is set up properly, it'll auto-switch to ruby 2.1.2 based on the .ruby-version file)
* `gem install bundler`


After installing bundler, you need to `bundle install`. This will install the gems we need.

That's all!
